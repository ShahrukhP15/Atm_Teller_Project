# Simple Atm
**Simple Atm** is a Java application aimed to keeping track of one's account and bank balance. 


## *An app to keep track of bank account transaction*


- The application can add or deposit money in cents
- Anyone with a bank account who needs to keep track of their account can use it.
- This project is of interest for me because in my country people use mostly cash and thus they lose track of their 
 bank accounts.So this will help them keep track of their accounts. Also, the bank can use it to help their customers 
 and also themselves keep track of a customer. 

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
