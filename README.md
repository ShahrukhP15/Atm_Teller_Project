# Simple Atm
**Simple Atm** is a Java application aimed to keeping track of one's account and bank balance. 


## *An app to keep track of bank account transaction*


- The application can add or deposit money in cents
- Anyone with a bank account who needs to keep track of their account can use it.
- This project is of interest for me because in my country people use mostly cash and thus they lose track of their 
 bank accounts.So this will help them keep track of their accounts. Also, the bank can use it to help their customers 
 and also themselves keep track of a customer. 

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.

##***User Story*** 

- As a user(bank) I want to be able to add money to my account. 

Suppose one day a person deposited some money in my bank . Now, I want that amount to be added to that person's account 
otherwise I might be cased with fraud for stealing money. A person will randomly add money to his account so I need to be 
able to keep track of how much that have included. 

 So, I included a class  **Account** which will keep track of one's transaction. And added the **deposit** feature which will add amount
 deposited to balance. 

Also, it can be used by common users to add money to their own accounts and, they can keep track of how much money they 
are adding to their account. 

- As a user, I want to be able to save the username and respective password for a account for security purpose and to access that account later.

- As a user I want to be able to save the total balance in my account.

- As a user, I want to be able to deposit and withdraw money from my account and save the amount after depositing or withdrawing money.

- As a user, I want to be able to load a specific account based on the username and password that I have saved.

- As a user, I want to load the amount in my account.

- As a user, I want to load the amount that is in my account after I had made a deposit to the account or I have withdrawn from an account.
